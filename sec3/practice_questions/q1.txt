1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
They can reduce the amount of code you have to type so you don't have to duplicate stuff.

2. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?
When it is called.

3. What statement defines a function?
x  Def?
-> def

4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
A function is an action and a function call is telling the action to execute.

5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
1 global scope and a local scope for every function.

6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
It becomes undefined.

7. What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?
x  Ends a function call
-> A return value is the value a function returns when it is called. A return value can be used
as an expression.

8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
x  It doesnt return anything.
-> It returns "None".

9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?
x  Defining it maybe.
-> global keyword ex:
def function():
    a = 10 # This is a local variable
    global b = 20 # This is a global variable

10. What is the data type of None?

You can say ">>> import $file" and you can use $file.function() to call the tool you want to use.
These $file's are called modules.

>>> import special_email
>>> 
>>> message = "Happy Birthday!"
>>> special_email.send_email(message)

12. If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam how would you call it after importing spam?
>>> import spam
>>>
>>> spam.bacon()

13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?
x  Typing except.
-> A try except clause:
>>> try:
